# ⚡ ElectrifyLabs Homepage

A static website built with pure HTML and CSS, created as a practice project to improve design-to-code conversion skills. The entire design was created By Me in Figma and then meticulously translated into clean, semantic HTML and CSS code.

- Converting Figma designs to pixel-perfect HTML/CSS
- Writing clean, semantic HTML structure
- Creating maintainable and organized CSS
- Understanding design implementation best practices
- Version control workflow with Git and GitHub

## 📝 Notes

This version is **non-responsive** as the focus was on implementing the design exactly as created in Figma. Future iterations may include responsive design updates.
